## Collections Page

The collections page is the main user interface of the site. It updates for mens or womens shoes respectively. The user can filter through different attribute combinations using the sleek dropdown menu underneath the header of the page. 

When selecting attributes, the selected options appear in place of the attribute title. The user may unselect specific options or 'clear filters'. On the left, the user can find an updated total of the current options. As shoes update to fit the given filter, the images render appropriately.
